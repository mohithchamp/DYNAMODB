Load data from s3 to dynamo db

Steps to Load the data

Please install serverless package golbally by running "npm install serverless -g" command
Configure the AWS account using cmd
using command "aws configure"
provide access key and sceret access key
provide default region and output format
Create a dynamodb table with the attributes required
Run npm install for install the required libraries.
In terminal, run command "serverless deploy", this will create the couldoformation template and get deployed on the configured aws account.
Once the s3 bucket is create add the below bucket access policy to the s3 bucket, so that the lambda can access the files from s3.
s3 bucket policy { "Id": "Policy1699469235147", "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "Stmt1699468300513", "Action": "s3:*", "Effect": "Allow", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::psstdynamodbbuckettest", // provide the arn of s3 bucket. "Principal": { "AWS": [ "arn:aws:iam::774104967360:role/source-dev-us-east-1-lambdaRole" //provide the arn of lambda role here ] } } ] }

-with these steps, we are all set to upload the file to s3 and it will trigger the lambda to push data to dynamo db.
